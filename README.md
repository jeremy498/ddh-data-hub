**Consent-First Data Infrastructure for the Enterprise**

Digital Data Holdings (DDH) provides the technology layer that enables large-scale, consented data exchange between individuals and businesses. We're building the infrastructure that makes data licensing transparent, auditable, and revocable by design.

## What We Do

DDH operates at the intersection of privacy and data utility. Our platform enables:

- **Private Data Brokerage** — Facilitating compliant data licensing between consenting individuals and vetted enterprise buyers
- **Consent-as-a-Service (CaaS)** — Providing the consent management infrastructure that powers purpose-limited data access
- **Data Pools** — Aggregating consented data into analyst-ready datasets for market research, AI training, and behavioral insights

## Our Approach

We believe the future of data is permissioned. Every data point that moves through our infrastructure is:

- **Consented** — Individuals explicitly opt-in with full visibility into how their data will be used
- **Purpose-Limited** — Data access is tied to specific, disclosed use cases
- **Auditable** — Complete chain of custody from consent to access
- **Revocable** — Individuals can withdraw consent at any time

## For Data Buyers

Access high-quality, consented datasets for market research, AI/ML training, and consumer insights. No regulatory gray areas. No reputational risk.

## For Data Partners

Integrate with DDH to offer your users fair compensation for their data while maintaining trust and transparency.

## Technology

This marketing site is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
